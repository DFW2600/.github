# DFW2600 Security Policy

DFW2600's [Bug Bounty program](https://gitcoin.co/daplanet) rewards researchers for discovering security vulnerabilities in a number of repositories. The full list of projects that are eligible for rewards are [available on our Bug Bounty site](https://gitcoin.co/daplanet).

If the repository is eligible for rewards, you can submit a report via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/daplanet). You can find more useful information in our [rules](https://dfw2600.dapla.net/ctf) and [FAQ](https://dfw2600.dapla.net/ctf/#faqs).

For repositories not covered by the Bug Bounty program, please open an issue.
